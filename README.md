# Penguin-Fighting

## A simple Unity project that was done in one day in January of 2023.
So it's a fighting game for 2 players playing on one keyboard that features:
* Few moves such as Jump, Hit, Slide
* Sound effects - Jump, Slide, Attack, Hit - and music
* Fully functioning UI: HUD with players' health bars, pause UI, game over UI
* And of course easily expandable and readable code for some future improvements and new features

All art and audio assets were downloaded for free from Unity asset store.
